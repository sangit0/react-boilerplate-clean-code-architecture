# Pages - Presentational Layer

The views/pages layer is the presentation layer of the application. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling the user interactions. It is the layer that the user interacts with directly.

## Example

- src/pages
  - src/pages/home
  - src/pages/about


### Presentation layer shouldn't contain business logic
